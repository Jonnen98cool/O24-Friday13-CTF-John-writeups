# O24-Friday13-CTF-John-writeups
I know how terrible it feels to have tried hard on a challenge, not quite gotten to the finnish line, and then never being able to know the solution! So here are writeups for my challenges.<br>

Please ping me on Discord if you managed to solve any challenge in an unintended way, we might even highlight your solution if it's really cool! Also you may contact me if you don't understand the writeups or if you have other questions.
