# O24-Friday13-CTF-John-writeups
I know how terrible it feels to have tried hard on a challenge, not quite gotten to the finnish line, and then never being able to know the solution! So here are writeups for my challenges.<br>

Please ping me on Discord if you managed to solve any challenge in an unintended way, we might even highlight your solution if it's really cool!
