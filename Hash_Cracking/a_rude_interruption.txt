1. The password is indeed found in rockyou, challenge is that the hash type is a little sus. It's: pw --> MD5 --> to_uppercase --> MD5. The idea is that you should try the recommended modes with hashcat until it works, takes like 8s on CPU for hashcat to go through rockyou with MD5-like hashes.
	hashcat -m 4300 605428f352781542abeafe5c1832d4aa ~/john_hacks/wordlists/login_credentials/rockyou.txt
