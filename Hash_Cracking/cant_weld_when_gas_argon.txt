1. hashes.txt can be extracted with steghide from the provided image, no password required
2. Reverse image search of cof.jpg reveals it's probably refering to Cry of Fear, image name supports this
3. You have to crack the argon2id hashes, For this I found 2 github crackers. Hashcat currently (okt 2024) doesnt support. You have to manually browse the wiki (https://cry-of-fear.fandom.com/wiki/Cry_of_Fear_Wiki) and create a custom wordlist from interesting phrases. This is a lot of work, building your own custom wordlist and hoping it will crack the hashes, but it's the only way. Most of the hashes are more than 1 word long. Here is an example program I used to test all hashes:
	python crack_argon2.py -c '$argon2id$v=19$m=19,t=2,p=1$TXI0bFBNcUlFaVV2bUw1OA$iSk840x8+46u+ljfUgV9BQ' -w ../../ctf_chall_15/cheat_wordlist.txt

EDIT: Turns out that manually finding interesting phrases is NOT the only way :D Good job to Jakob for solving the challenge by essentially creating a crawler which extracts phrases based on some regex.<br>
EDIT again: Made my own crawler and scraper which extracts 1,2,3,4-word phrases from the wiki: <https://github.com/Jonnen98cool/webcrawler_phrases_extractor>
