1. A little tricky, as the hash provided is a single MD5-looking hash. But the hash is infact two stitched together half-MD5 hashes (hashcat mode 5100). The idea is that the description and title should hint towards this.
2. Divide the single hash into two hashes at the halfway mark, these are the ones you are supposed to crack with -m 5100 and rockyou.txt:
	hashcat -m 5100 hashes.txt ~/john_hacks/wordlists/login_credentials/rockyou.txt
3. Flag:   stitch@together
