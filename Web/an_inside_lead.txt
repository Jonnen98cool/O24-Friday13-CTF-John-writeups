1. First flag and the TODO list necessary for next step is found at /admin/todo.txt (this is a route as opposed to a folder)
2. Next step is bruteforce /api?auth=*number*    Here you test numbers 0-99 according to the todo list. auth=39 is the correct number.
3. Backdoor for /admin (also hinted at inside the todo list) is requesting /admin with X-Forwarded-For: 192.168.0.101
4. When inside /admin, the X-Forwarded-For: 192.168.0.101 trick does not work when trying to change CTF title, but it does work for "Show Users" which will reveal the admin session_id
5. We can now log in with the admin session id
6. "Change Title" is vulnerable to second-order error-based SQL injection (injecting a ' will give verbose error). Inject in Burp:   title=0wn3d'+||+(SELECT+password+FROM+user+WHERE+id+=+4)--
7. Go to / and the flag is in the title.
