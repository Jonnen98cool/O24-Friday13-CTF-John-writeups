1. Intercepting a request to / shows that there is an API:   GET /skrotg%C3%A5rn?p=1&s=0&q=1 HTTP/1.1
	- Setting s=1 includes special items in the search
	- Setting q=0 sets minimum quantity to 0, silverstål now pops up
2. Goal is to purchase the silverstål, but we have no money!
	- Notice the Holset turbo special item with a 50% discount. Attempting to purchase it triggers a:   GET /k%C3%B6p_skrot/5?50 HTTP/1.1   where the parameter name "50" is the discount (this parameter has no value). Setting it to 100 allows us to purchase the item.
3. Now we can "afford" silverstål, but it is still out of stock.
	- If we set q=-10000 or less we will get a new item called "???". This reveals (in swedish) that we can use a CRANE method for a digital interface to scrapyard crane, and that the code for this crane is 1234. 
	- We could also have found this CRANE methodby running OPTIONS on /skrotgårn
	- Now we can use the following parameters to update the stock:   CRANE /skrotg%C3%A5rn?code=1234&getXFromScrapyard=10&itemId=3 HTTP/1.1
4. With silverstål now in stock, we can use what we've learned and purchase it, completing the challenge.
